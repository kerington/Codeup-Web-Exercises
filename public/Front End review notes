Traversing - What is jQuery traversing?

Ajax Requests- Is it just refreshing the information without refreshing the page?


~-LOOPS-~
	* while loop (condition) {whatever is in here will be repeated again and again until the condition is false!}
		- (might not run EVER)
		- condition -> when to continue
		- boolean expression -> something that returns true/false
		- when to use it?
			- If you probably don't want to repeat the code not even once

	* do-while
		do {

		} while (condition)

		- [do {] - will always run at least once. 
		- Use this when you want to repeat the code at least once.

	* for (var i = 0;condition;i++) {

	}
		- counter -> know in advance how many times the code will be repeated
			- because you're counting
		- use for arrays
		- var i = 0 IS USED FOR initialization... make sure you start at 0 or wherever you want to start. 
		- i++ allows the loop to go up every time. 


* while - do while loops -> because you can't count how many times you want it to repeat. Can't think of the solution to this problem.
* for loop -> used when you can count how many things need to happen.
